<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.

If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font
Bakery could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure
call (rpc).

There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/master/prebuilt/workarounds
/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator

* ‚ö† **WARN** Could not find ftxvalidator.

<summary>üíî <b>ERROR:</b> Check if the vertical metrics of a family are similar to the same family hosted on Google Fonts.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/vertical_metrics_regressions](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vertical_metrics_regressions)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

If the family already exists on Google Fonts, we need to ensure that the
checked family&#x27;s vertical metrics are similar. This check will test the
following schema which was outlined in Fontbakery issue #1162 [1]:

- The family should visually have the same vertical metrics as the Regular
style hosted on Google Fonts.
- If the family on Google Fonts has differing hhea and typo metrics, the family
being checked should use the typo metrics for both the hhea and typo entries.
- If the family on Google Fonts has use typo metrics not enabled and the family
being checked has it enabled, the hhea and typo metrics should use the family
on Google Fonts winAscent and winDescent values.
- If the upms differ, the values must be scaled so the visual appearance is the
same.

<summary>üíî <b>ERROR:</b> Check font follows the Google Fonts CJK vertical metric schema</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/cjk_vertical_metrics](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/cjk_vertical_metrics)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

CJK fonts have different vertical metrics when compared to Latin fonts. We
follow the schema developed by dr Ken Lunde for Source Han Sans and the Noto
CJK fonts.

Our documentation includes further information:
https://github.com/googlefonts/gf-docs/tree/master/Spec#cjk-vertical-metrics

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Are there caret positions declared for every ligature?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard
shortcut.

If designing with UFOs, (as of Oct 2020) ligature carets are not yet compiled
by ufo2ft, and therefore will not build via FontMake. See
googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues/329


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** This font lacks caret positioning values for these ligature glyphs:
	- lam_lam_yehar
	- uniFC31
	- uniFC32
	- uniFC40
	- uniFEFB.short
	- yeh_hamzaar

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?</summary>

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:
	- f + f
	- f + i
	- i + f
	- f + l
	- l + f
	- i + i.loclTRK
	- i.loclTRK + l
	- uniFED3 + uniFEF0
	- uniFEF0 + uniFEF2
	- uni0644 + uni0627.short
	- uniFEDF + uniFEE0
	- uniFEE0 + uniFEF2
	- uniFEF2 + uniFEA2
	- uniFEA2 + uniFEE0
	- uniFEF3 + uni0621

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Glyph names are all valid?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/valid_glyphnames](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/valid_glyphnames)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Microsoft&#x27;s recommendations for OpenType Fonts states the following:

&#x27;NOTE: The PostScript glyph name must be no longer than 31 characters, include
only uppercase or lowercase English letters, European digits, the period or the
underscore, i.e. from the set [A-Za-z0-9_.] and should start with a letter,
except the special glyph name &quot;.notdef&quot; which starts with a period.&#x27;

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/recom#post-table


In practice, though, particularly in modern environments, glyph names can be as
long as 63 characters.
According to the &quot;Adobe Glyph List Specification&quot; available at:

https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-specification


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** The following glyph names may be too long for some legacy systems which may expect a maximum 31-char length limit:
hahTahTwodotshorizontalbelowar.fina.h2 and hahTahTwodotshorizontalbelowar.medi.h2 [code: legacy-long-names]
