## Kufam design information

Kufam is a Arabic-Latin bilingual typeface intended for contemporary information design such as signage and wayfinding systems. Kufam Arabic is inspired by 7th-century Kufi inscriptions. The dark, condensed shapes of this early Kufi script also served as an inspiration for Kufam's Latin lowercase, as where the Latin capitals find their roots in lettering as frequently seen in signage and shop lettering in Amsterdam at the beginning of the twentieth century. All these inspirations from sources in different periods in history of the Arabic and Latin world cumulate in a contemporary, legible and aesthetically rich design for use across different media.

## Kufam history

Kufam was conceived within the framework of The typographic matchmaking 2.0 project during the period 2008-2010. Several design teams were given the task to design a new font family and simultaneously develop the Arabic and Latin character set. It was the projects brief that he fonts would have to function within the Western (Amsterdam) and Eastern (Dubai) modern urban. These efforts resulated in an 5 weight family with an Arabic and Latin roman and italic characterset.

In 2014 Kufam was published on the now defunct type label OurType, where the font development team expanded the characterset from Standard to Pro and remastered the fonts. Kufam was available on OurType until 2017 on this label.

From 2018 Kufam was reworked to meet Google Fonts Latin Expert and Arabic charactersets and in 2019 Kufam was made available on Google Fonts.
